! Notes on using the Text Proposal (.prop) File:
!
! 1) Do NOT edit the APT generated sub-exposure information. 
!
!   a) If you are copying or moving individual exposures, 
!      you should delete the sub-exposure keyword(s) first.
!
!   b) If you are copying entire visits, you should delete the
!      sub-exposure keywords in the new visit if you will be making 
!      changes such as adding or moving exposures.
!
! 2) You must put a COMMA between optional parameters and a SEMICOLON
!    between special requirements.
!
! 3) The .prop file format is very similar to the old RPS2 file, but
!    there are some differences.  If you need to update a script that
!    writes out a .prop file please note the following major differences
!    (see the Phase II Proposal Instructions for full details):
!
!    * new PI/Co-I format
!    * carriage return is no longer a valid delimiter (see item 2 above)
!    * special requirement names more restrictive (only one way to specify)
!    * exposure times must be in seconds
!    * exposure lists must be a range (1-5 legal, 1,2,3-5 not legal)

Abstract:
We are now entering an era in which large scale surveys of the sky will discover numerous transients each night. The number of targets that could benefit from HST observations on timescales of less than three weeks will easily exceed the ability of HST to schedule disruptive ToO observations. Here we propose to use a variant of snapshot scheduling that allows transients to be observed as soon as 11 days after discovery with little to no additional overhead compared to a standard snapshot program. "Rolling Snapshots'' will allow us to double the number of SNe with near UV spectra in the HST archive. Our largely volume limited sample will aid in the calibration of Type Ia SNe as distance indicators, and may prove particularly useful for comparison with Type Ia SNe near the redshift limit of the LSST.  These observations will allow us to  break the degeneracy between temperature and metallicity in core collapse SNe, as well as probe the interaction between the violently expanding material and its surrounding medium, thus constraining the mass loss and evolutionary history of the progenitor star. Through measurements of the the line depths and chemical content of the expanding material of superluminous supernovae we will  help distinguish between a central power source or interaction with the circumstellar medium dominating the emission, and in combination with ground-based observations we will obtain a complete picture of these objects -- something which is much more difficult at the higher redshifts where they are usually found. Finally, as our raw data and our reduced spectra will be made publicly available, they should provide a valuable resource to the entire community.


Questions

    Observing_Description:
Here we propose a survey using a new observing technique: Rolling Snapshots. In a standard snapshot program, the observer provides a queue of an allotted number of targets, typically with a total exposure time of twenty minutes or less. The schedulers use the queues of the snapshot programs to fill in gaps in the HST observing program. In standard snapshot programs the program queue is static; however, in a Rolling Snapshot program the program queue can be updated once a week shortly before the Institute rebuilds the entire queue from which it chooses snapshots.

Snapshot programs usually observe around one-third of their targets. Thus to obtain a desired sample of ~ 30 objects, we would usually need a list of order 100 targets. We expect to have about 9 active targets in our list in any given week. As per our discussions with the HST schedulers, it is possible for us to build our Phase II so that the probability that one of our targets chosen would be the same as if we had 100 targets in our list when we start, and 99 after our first successful observation, etc. Thus our expected number of snaps, and the probability of receiving a snap at any time, will be the same as if we started with a fixed target list of 100.

We propose to use the WFC3/UVIS grism to obtain UV spectra of transients shortly after outburst. We will use the G280 grism to obtain the NUV spectrum, and will typically take 2x250s dithered exposures. We will also obtain a short F300X direct image of the field, and a somewhat longer (~ 1 minute) exposure in the F350LP filter. These images have two purposes. The F300X image will serve as the reference image allowing us to set the wavelength scale of the spectra. The F350LP image serves another purpose entirely. We expect that in over twenty-five percent of our objects the first order spectrum of the transient will land on a the zeroth order spectrum of the host galaxy in a region where the zeroth order spectrum is bright enough to contribute noticeable contamination. The F350LP filter has very similar throughput to the zeroth order of the G280 grism. We have found that we can convolve this image to match the slight blurring of the zeroth order G280 grism and then scale and subtract it, dramatically reducing contamination from the zeroth order host image (See Figure 1).

In order to fit the multiple short exposures in a snapshot orbit, we will use a subarray to avoid buffer dumps. However, APT does not allow the use of the standard subarrays with the G280, so we will be using the custom 1k X 1k subarray used in the Rolling Snapshot test program. As this proposal demonstrates, we have software that will handle this subarray data and we will make our reduced spectra available to the community through The Weizmann Interactive Supernova Data Repository (WISeREP).

We will have ground-based images of the fields both before and during the SN. When it appears that the roll of the telescope would place the spectrum on a particularly bright region of a host, we will not include that supernova in the weekly queue. Additionally, in the case of a core-collapse SN, the explosion may happen right on top of an HII region. In this case there will be contamination to the spectra that will be hard to remove without a second (reference) epoch. However, we will be observing Type II SNe within 100 Mpc. As a result, early ground-based imaging will give us a good idea which objects would likely fall on a bright HII region, and where it appears that contamination would substantially affect our result, we would again not include that SN in the queue.

Some rare objects, like an M51 transient that was observed as the first test object of the Rolling Snapshot idea, may require imaging with filters other than we have described here. However, we plan to use WFC3 for all our observations.

To ensure robust sample statistics, as well as good signal-to-noise in our spectra, we define a volume for each flavor of supernova that we plan to follow-up. Specifically, we plan to limit our sample to 100 Mpc for SNe II (~1.7 per week) and 150 Mpc for SNe Ib/c (~1 per week), 150 Mpc for SNe Ia (~4 per week) and SLSNe out to z=0.3 (~1 per week (in some cases, these can remain near peak for several weeks, meaning more than one SLSNe would on average be a good target at any one time). For TDE's we will limit ourselves to those we expect will have mNUV < 19.5. We would expect one of these per month, and it would be observable for most or all of the month in many cases. In weeks in which Palomar has poor weather, we will complement the ZTF list with sources from other surveys with spectroscopic identifications. An example target list chosen from the public spectroscopically complete ZTF survey is shown in Table 1. These rates ensure we will have an abundant supply of targets spread throughout the sky on any given week in Cycle 29.

The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -59" -76".

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -61" -80".

The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -61" -80".

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -59" -76".

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -61" -80".

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -61" -80".

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -59" -76".

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -61" -80".

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -61" -80".

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -59" -76".

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -61" -80".

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -61" -80".

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -59" -76".

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -61" -80".

By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -61" -80".

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -61" -80".

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -59" -76".

The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -61" -80".

Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

             Comments: We are effectively duplicating the UVIS2-C1K1C-SUB aperture, but using the UVIS aperture appropriate for G280. The nominal position is 537.0, 512.0 while for UVIS, it's 2073.0, 250.0 (or effectively 2073.0, 2332). So we want a POSTARG of -61".0, -72".0. This was slightly refined in Aladin.

From SB: One minor comment I'd have is to consider shifting the area for the subarray readout slightly to the left, in order to include the left overscan i.e. decrease CENTERAXIS1 by 23. By including the overscan columns in the subarray, the calibration software can compute the correction using the image itself rather than using a default look-up value. Note: 23 not 25 is the number of overscan pixels for a subarray. New note: CENTERAXIS includes overscan, so use 513. DR note: 515 to stop the warnings.

DR Note: Moving an additional 4" to better remove offset between F350LP and G280 to -61" -80".
